# UART String Transmission
This project involves transmitting a string over UART on an Arduino or AVR microcontroller.

### Overview
- The code initializes UART communication and sends the string "Hello, world!" repeatedly with a delay of 1 second between transmissions.

### Usage
- Upload the code to the Arduino or AVR board.
- Open a serial monitor (e.g., Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor) to view the transmitted string.
### Components
- Arduino.h (or avr/io.h for AVR): Header file for Arduino or AVR.
- serial.h: Header file containing UART communication functions.
- uart_init(): Function to initialize UART.
- uart_putchar(): Function to transmit a character via UART.
- uart_putstr(): Function to transmit a string via UART.
### How It Works
- The setup function initializes UART communication using uart_init().
- In the loop function, the string "Hello, world!" is transmitted over UART using uart_putstr().
- A delay of 1 second (delay(1000)) is added between transmissions.
### Note
- Ensure proper connections for UART communication (e.g., USB cable for Arduino).
- Adjust baud rate (BAUD) and UART settings (UCSR0B, UCSR0C, etc.) as needed.
